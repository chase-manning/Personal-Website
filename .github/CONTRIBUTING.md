# Contribution Guide

Hi and welcome to the contribution guide!  
Thanks for considering to contribute to the website.

## Found a Bug

If you have found a bug, great job!  
Please don't hesitate to create an Issue for it so it can be fixed.  
Please make sure to add the `bug` Label, and if appropriate, the `good first issue` Label.  
If you want to fix the bug yourself, then also assign the Issue to yourself and keep reading!

## Got a Suggestion

Suggestions to improve the website or codebase are very welcomed!  
Please first create an Issue with the idea.  
If it improves the site for visitors, assign it the `enhancement` tag, or if it is technical, then assign it the `technical` tag.  
If the goal of the suggestion is to try increase visitor conversion, then we will need to validate it to prove that it increases conversion.  
Just be sure to add the `requires validation` tag, and I will take care of doing the validation once you have created a PR.

## Issues

There are a bunch of [open issues](https://github.com/chase-manning/Personal-Website/issues) that would be great if you could help with.  
Feel free to work on any issue that isn't already assigned to someone.  
Issues that are tagged with [good first issue](https://github.com/chase-manning/Personal-Website/labels/good%20first%20issue) are the best place to start.

## Projects

There are two projects which contain all the issues for the repo.  

### Conversion Rate Optimisation
This project holds all of the issues that are aimed at increasing visitor conversion rate.  
All of these issues require validation and AB testing before going into production.  
They are split out in a seperate project from the rest of the issues becuase they have a very different development workflow.  
These issues are a bit more complicated to contribute to so probably aren't the best place to start as a new contributor.  

The `Requires Validation` column is for Issues that need to be AB Tested to ensure they have a positive impact on conversion.  
We can only test so many issues at once, so those are ones that are waiting in the queue.  
Issues tagged with `Validating` are currently in the process of being AB Tested, and will be moved to `Closed` once validated.

### Personal Website
This project holds all generic issues that don't require validation.  
The issues in this project are ordered by their perceived priority and so this is a good place to see what to work on.  

## Development Workflow

If you are contributing, please create a branch off of Master.  
Make your changes in this branch until you are happy.  
And then create a PR back into Master.  
Please also link the Issue that the PR relates to, and include a screenshot of your changes if relevant

## Anything Goes

Don't feel like you have to restrict yourself to the existing Issues.  
If you have any cool idea at all, please go for it!  
There are no wrong answers, and it will be fun to see what works when it is validated and can see the impact on visitors :)
