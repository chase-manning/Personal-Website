# Contribution Guide
Hi and welcome to the contribution guide!  
Thanks for considering to contribute to the website.

## Found a Bug?
If you have found a bug, great job!  
Please don't hesitate to create an Issue for it so it can be fixed.  
Please make sure to add the `bug` Label, and if appropriate, the `good first issue` Label.  
If you want to fix the bug yourself, then also assign the Lssue to yourself and keep reading!

## Got a Suggestion?
Suggestions to improve the website or codebase are very welcomed!  
Please first create an Issue with the idea.  
If it improves the site for visitors, assign it the `enhancement` tag, or if it is technical, then assign it the `technical` tag.  
If the goal of the suggestion is to try increase visitor conversion, then we will need to validate it to prove that it increases conversion.  
Just be sure to add the `requires validation` tag, and I will take care of doing the validation once you have created a PR.

## Issues
There are a bunch of [open issues](https://github.com/chase-manning/Personal-Website/issues) that would be great if you could help with.  
Feel free to work on any issue that isn't already assigned to someone.  
Issues that are tagged with [good first issue](https://github.com/chase-manning/Personal-Website/labels/good%20first%20issue) are the best place to start.

## Projects
There is one project which contains all of the issues for the repo.  
The issues in this project are ordered by their perceived priority and so this is a good place to see what to work on.  
The `Requires Validation` column is for Issues that need to be AB Tested to ensure they have a positive impact on conversion.  
We can only test so many issues at once, so those are ones that are waiting in the queue.  
Issues tagged with `Validating` are currently in the process of being AB Tested, and will be moved to `closed` once validated.

## Development Workflow
If you are contributing, please create a branch off of Master.  
Make your changes in this branch until you are happy.  
And then create a PR back into Master.  
Please also link the Issue that the PR relates to, and also include a screenshot of your changes if relevant

## Anything Goes!
Don't feel like you have to restrict yourself to the existing Issues.  
If you have any cool idea at all, please go for it!  
There are no wrong answers, and it will be fun to see what works when it is validated and can see the impact on visitors :)
