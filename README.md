## Contributing

If you are interested in contributing, please check out the open issues.  
Look for the Label `good first issue` as that will be the best place to start.  
Create a Branch from Master and then a PR with the change.

Most issues are validated with AB Testing before being merged and closed.  
Issues that require validation are Labeled with `requires validation`.  
I will do the validation though, so just create the PR and I will merge in when it's been validated.

Feel free to contribute any changes though, any cool ideas for improvement or new features are welcome!
